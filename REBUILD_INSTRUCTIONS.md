# Fix MapStruct Generation Errors

## Problem
MapStruct generated code (`PatientMapperImpl.java`) has errors because it's stale and needs regeneration.

## Solution

### Option 1: IntelliJ IDEA (Recommended)
1. **Build Menu** → **Rebuild Project** (or press `Ctrl+Shift+F9`)
2. This will clean and regenerate all MapStruct mappers

### Option 2: Maven Command Line
```bash
cd MediConnect
mvn clean compile
```

### Option 3: Manual Clean (if above don't work)
1. Right-click on `MediConnect` project in IntelliJ
2. Select **Maven** → **Reload Project**
3. Then **Build** → **Rebuild Project**

## What Was Fixed
✅ Removed unused imports from `PatientController.java`
✅ Removed unused fields from `PatientController.java` (they were only in commented code)
✅ Fixed deprecated `DaoAuthenticationProvider` constructor in `SecurityConfig.java`
✅ Fixed unused local variables in `PatientServiceImpl.java`
✅ Removed unused `@Autowired` import from `NotificationController.java`

## Remaining Warnings (Non-Critical)
- MapStruct unmapped properties warnings - These are informational only
- `otpService` warning in `HealthProviderController` - False positive (it IS used at line 771)

## After Rebuild
The MapStruct errors should disappear once the code is regenerated. The `PatientProfileResponseDTO` class exists and is correctly imported in `PatientMapper.java`, so MapStruct just needs to regenerate the implementation.
