# Fix IntelliJ IDEA Indexing Issues

## Problem
IntelliJ IDEA is showing compilation errors (red squiggly lines) even though Maven build succeeded. This is an **indexing issue**, not an actual compilation problem.

## Solution

### Method 1: Invalidate Caches and Restart (Recommended)
1. Go to **File** → **Invalidate Caches / Restart...**
2. Select **Invalidate and Restart**
3. Wait for IntelliJ to restart and re-index the project
4. The errors should disappear once indexing completes

### Method 2: Reload Maven Project
1. Open the **Maven** tool window (View → Tool Windows → Maven, or click the Maven icon on the right sidebar)
2. Click the **Reload All Maven Projects** button (circular arrows icon)
3. Wait for Maven to reload

### Method 3: Manual Rebuild
1. Go to **Build** → **Rebuild Project**
2. Wait for the rebuild to complete

### Method 4: Force Re-index
1. Right-click on the `MediConnect` project folder in the Project view
2. Select **Maven** → **Reload Project**
3. Then go to **File** → **Synchronize** (or press `Ctrl+Alt+Y`)

## Verification
After any of the above methods:
- The red error indicators should disappear
- The **Build** → **Rebuild Project** command should succeed
- You should be able to run your Spring Boot application without IDE errors

## What Was Fixed
✅ Updated `pom.xml` to fix Java version mismatch (Java 24 in properties, but compiler plugin was set to 17)
✅ Maven build succeeded - compiled 113 source files
✅ All MapStruct mappers generated successfully

## Note
If errors persist after trying all methods, you may need to:
1. Close IntelliJ IDEA completely
2. Delete the `.idea` folder in your project (make a backup first)
3. Reopen IntelliJ IDEA and re-import the project as a Maven project
